# Heart-Disease-prediction




## ‚≠ê Overview

This is a we app designed to provide accessible and accurate heart disease risk predictions, empowering individuals to take proactive steps towards better cardiovascular health.

> ### The Problem
> Cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early detection and risk assessment are paramount for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. However, access to specialized medical consultations and the complexity of interpreting various health indicators can often be a barrier for many, leading to delayed diagnoses and missed opportunities for preventive care. There's a critical need for an accessible, user-friendly tool that can provide initial risk insights, encouraging individuals to consult healthcare professionals when necessary.

> ### The Solution
> `Heart-Disease-prediction` addresses this challenge by leveraging a robust machine learning model to predict heart disease risk based on common health parameters. Built with simplicity and accessibility in mind, it offers an interactive web application that allows users to input their health data and instantly receive an informed risk assessment. This project aims to democratize access to predictive health analytics, serving as a valuable educational tool and a first step in a proactive health management journey.

### Inferred Architecture
The project is architected as a lightweight, interactive web application powered by **Streamlit**. At its core, it utilizes a pre-trained **Scikit-learn Logistic Regression model** (`logistic_regression.pkl`) for heart disease prediction. This model, along with a data scaler (`scalar.pkl`) and feature column definitions (`columns.pkl`), forms the intelligence layer. User input via the Streamlit interface is preprocessed using the loaded scaler, fed into the model, and the prediction is then displayed. The `.devcontainer` configuration also suggests a focus on providing a consistent and reproducible development environment using **VS Code Dev Containers**. The `my-heart.ipynb` notebook indicates a solid foundation in data exploration and model development.
